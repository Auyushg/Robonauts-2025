This is a repository for the Arm and Elevator for the Robonauts 2025 Robot "Firefly", where long PVC pipes(called coral), and large dodgeball pieces(algae) needed to be scored on the "reef", at different elevations from the for

This code base is my final code developemnt for the Robonauts as a student, and the most sophisticated.

It includes a cpp and h file for the arm and elevator file(called "liftControl) and their respective header file, as well as an exclusive class that coordinates movement and elevation throughout the robot(Called "LiftMotor") - it ensures the arm and elevator do not crash with another part of the robot
The CoralLoopFloor and CoralLoopFloorBody are Lua files that command the robot during the 15-second autonomous period(this code moves the robot autonomously)


***Note: all Robonauts codebases were developed in collaboration with the software team***
